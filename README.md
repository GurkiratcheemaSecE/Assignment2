I wanted to make it a like a more like earthy natural adventure type of website that is why I chose that background picture .  
So at first I wanted to add a background video to my landing page website to be more asthetic but was not able to so I resorted toa image .
I did not have much of a problem with the Media Queries they were simple ingough but I spenta lot of time trying to make the backgound video working .
